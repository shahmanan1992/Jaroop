This program uses MediaWiki, an API to retrieve complete information from wikipedia about any existing topic in wikipedia. The resulting output can be obtained in xml and json. For this program, I have used JSON as it is easy to debug and retrieve required information easily. Apart from API, complexity is also taken care of till some point for which StringBuilder is used to store complete information. Modifications are performed on this string as it is mutable and doesn't require more memory.Some sanitization is also performed to remove unwanted HTML tags and characters. Currently, the program also takes input from command line and if nothing entered, then prompts user to enter any word to search.First letter of each word is capitalized and are spaces between words are replaced with '%20' instead of underscore as per API requirement. Exception is handled for case when unappropriate word is searched and "Not Found" on Wikipedia.
